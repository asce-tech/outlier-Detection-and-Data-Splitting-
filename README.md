# Project Name 
# Outlier-Detection-and-Data-Splitting-
IQR Outlier Detection and Data Splitting

## Objective
A Python program that takes a CSV file as input, performs Interquartile Range (IQR) outlier 
detection on a specified column, and splits the dataset into outliers and non-outliers. The program 
should generate summary statistics for the original, outlier, and non-outlier subsets of the dataset, and  
save the split datasets as separate CSV files. No plotting is necessary. The summary statistics must 
be printed out in the console.

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to analyze CSV files using Python code
- Developed a command-line tool to tackle dataset preprocessing and outlier analysis efficiently.
- Experience with loading, processing, and exporting data in CSV format.
- Ability to calculate key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and IQR.
- Skilled in handling data through libraries like pandas and numpy.

### Libraries Used

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy for numerical computations.
- Seaborn for statistical data visualization.
- Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Steps
- Start by importing essential libraries
- Command-Line Argument Handling
- Read the CSV File
- Extract the Specified Column
- Perform IQR Outlier Detection
- Calculate Summary Statistics
- Save Outliers and Non-Outliers to CSV
